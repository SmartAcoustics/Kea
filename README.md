# Kea

Some useful HDL blocks. Currently the mainly useful stuff is an axi lite 
register subsystem, along with supporting AXI Lite and Stream interfaces and
associated BFMs.

The usage documentation is sparse, but the spec is tightly defined (see the
relevant test code for how it should work).

Check out the `examples` directory for how to use kea.
